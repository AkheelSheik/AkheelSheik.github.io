                <h3>Battery Management PCB</h3>

                <p>The purpose of this PCB was to monitor 22 battery cells. This involved using an ASIC as
                    the core element and the other circuits are peripheral to the ASIC. A lot of the project involved
                    interpreting the ASIC datasheet and how to use it. The PCB consisted of 4 layers and 10 polygons.
                    The main reason was that there was genuinely no space for routing and maintaining rules compliance
                    for FS (formula student) competitions. </p>

                <h3>Documentation of BMS Debugging</h3>
                <p> It was paramount to document all BMS debugging as this would be vital to reflect on the design and short-comings that was observed through testing.
                     Furthermore, I had to use tools such as oscilloscopes and function generator. </p>

                <h3>Battery Management PCB Testing Board</h3>
                <p>This PCB was created in response to extremely long hours of testing set up. The previous version of
                    the battery management PCB above had 23 cells, and it was a nightmare to test the functionality as
                    there was about 46 inputs to simulate, and this had to be manually soldered on to the rectangular
                    taps. Hence this PCB consisted of testing pins and simulate the input the signals to the battery
                    management PCB. This led to faster PCB testing as the initial set up time was very low.</p>

                <h3>Tractive System Active Light controller PCB</h3>
                <p>This was one of my earlier PCB that was done during my time in Monash Motorsport. This PCB was a lot
                    simpler in the sense that it was majorly consisted of And/Or gate ICs. It contained an output power
                    stage to provide power to high power LEDs. In addition, contains a lot of debugging LEDs; this was
                    so that it was easier to debug the PCB and ensuring that the functionality of the PCB was tested.
                    This was important as this PCB is a Safety critical PCB in FS competition.</p>

                <h3>BMS firmware development</h3>
                <p>The BMS firmware was written in embedded C/C++, and it was written to take data from the ASIC which
                    was used to measure the battery cell data then it was stored in an object. The micro-controllers that were used for the BMS firmware were Teensy 3.2 and PSOC. Further initiated plans to move to a singular micro-controller which is the STM-32. It also used unit testing, which was something new that I had learned and implemented. This was especially useful for writing cell algorithms and was useful to simulate the data of
                    the car without needing to access to the car.
