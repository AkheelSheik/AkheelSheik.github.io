                <h3>Battery Management PCB</h3>
                                
                <p>The purpose of this PCB was to monitor 22 battery cells. This involved using an ASIC as the core element and the other circuits are peripheral to the ASIC. The PCB consisted of 4 layers and 10 polygons. The main reason was that there was genuinely no space for routing and maintaining rules compliance for FS (formula student) competitions.</p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>PCB with all layers</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The top layer consisted of a lot of the signal routing and had 2 small polygons. The 2 polygons were ground planes. This was to further reduce the capacitance to ground by having ground plane that surrounded the main ICs(integrated circuits), so there is limited high frequency noise in the power signals of the ICs.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                
                <p>The second layer consisted of ground planes and very low amount of routing. Two reasons for this, first reason is that generally the middle layers of the board will be ground planes to reduce noise in digital signals. Furthermore, makes manufacturability of PCBs a lot easier. As these copper planes won't be needed to be cut as much.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>The third layer contains ground planes but also has the power plane. This again was done for manufacturability of the PCB has having common power rails means less routing between components and it can be just connected to one plane.</p>

                <h3>Documentation of BMS Debugging</h3>
                <p>In this testing report it showcases some of the steps taken to debug a PCB and it ends as soon as one of the important ICs gets damaged. This testing report also shows the shortcomings of the old testing method without the testing board.</p>

                <p>In this documentation, there is an accumulation of all the common problems into one document and this was done so debugging can become more streamlined. Furthermore, it is easier to learn the part for future electrical systems engineers working on the project.</p>

                <h3>Battery Management PCB Testing Board</h3>
                <p>This PCB was created in response to extremely long hours of testing set up. The previous version of the battery management PCB above had 23 cells, and it was a nightmare to test the functionality as there was about 46 inputs to simulate, and this had to be manually soldered on to the rectangular taps. Hence this PCB consisted of testing pins and simulate the input the signals to the battery management PCB. This led to faster PCB testing as the initial set up time was very low.</p>

                <h3>Tractive System Active Light controller PCB</h3>
                <p>This was one of my earlier PCB that was done during my time in Monash Motorsport. This PCB was a lot simpler in the sense that it was majorly consisted of And/Or gate ICs. It contained an output power stage to provide power to high power LEDs. In addition, contains a lot of debugging LEDs; this was so that it was easier to debug the PCB and ensuring that the functionality of the PCB was tested. This was important as this PCB is a rules critical PCB in FS competition.</p>

                <h3>BMS firmware development</h3>
                <p>The BMS firmware was written in embedded C/C++, and it was written to take data from the ASIC which was used to measure the battery cell data then it was stored in an object. The code was compiled in platformio ide. Furthermore, I was working on moving code from a teensy to STM32 and looking to implement RTOS.</p>
                <p>Here is a class diagram of it.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The BMS firmware also used unit testing, this was something new that I had learned and implemented. This was especially useful for writing cell algorithms. This was so that it can simulate the data of the car without needing to access to the car.</p>
